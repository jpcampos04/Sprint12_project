# :moneybag: Gold Recovery Prediction Model

## 🧠 Description
This project aims to build a predictive model that helps a mining company estimate the amount of gold recovered from gold ore using historical production data.  
In addition, the project analyzes the concentration levels of different chemical elements involved in the gold extraction process across multiple processing stages.

The objective is to improve production efficiency, understand process behavior, and support data-driven decision-making in mineral processing.
